# Exam-Monitoring-System
This repository presents an advanced exam monitoring system leveraging the powerful YOLOv8 object detection model. The system is designed to efficiently detect and track students' activities during exams, ensuring fairness and preventing cheating.

Key Features:

- Real-time object detection: Utilizes YOLOv8 to accurately identify students, their faces, and other relevant objects in the exam environment.
- Activity tracking: Monitors student behavior, such as head movements, hand gestures, and object interactions, to detect potential cheating activities.
- Anomaly detection: Leverages machine learning algorithms to identify unusual patterns or behaviors that may indicate cheating.
- Alert system: Generates real-time alerts to proctors or administrators when suspicious activities are detected. 
- Integration capabilities: Can be easily integrated into existing exam proctoring systems or surveillance infrastructure.
